## [0.4.0] - 2024-09-06

### Changed
- `getDefaultAddress` wallet method updated to return a promise, and `getAddress` wallet methods now return a promise and `WalletAddress` instead of `Address`. Both functions will now fetch addresses for the wallet if they haven't been loaded.

## [0.3.0] - 2024-09-05

### Added

- Add support for list address transactions.
- Add support for exporting the private key of a `WalletAddress`
- Add support for creating arbitrary payload signatures.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- USDC Faucet support on Base Sepolia
- Improved error messages for `InternalError`

## [0.1.1] - 2024-08-27

- Fixed a bug where `listHistoricalBalances` method was parsing conventional ETH balances instead of atomic units

## [0.1.0] - 2024-08-22

### Added

- Add `listHistoricalBalances` wallet method, that lists the historical balances for the wallet's default address.
- Add toAddressId() method to Transaction class

### Removed

- Remove user concept from the SDK
- Remove "pending" status from StakingOperationStatusEnum
- Add staking operation class helper methods like `isTerminalState`, `isFailedState` and `isCompleteState`.
- Add validator status enum

### Changed

- The `createTransfer` and `createTrade` functions no longer wait for the transactions to confirm or
  fail on-chain.
  - Now they return a `Transfer` and `Trade` object respectively, which support the `wait`
    function, e.g. `await transfer.wait()`.
  - This ensures that the developer has a reference to the object in case there is a timeout while
    waiting to land on-chain.
- Update `reload()` method to work with both External and Wallet address.
- Update `createStakingOperation` logic to make sure we only pull in newer unsigned txs from the server.
  This is especially important for External Address use-case where tx signing and broadcast status is maintained on client side, and we risk overwriting the existing txs.
- Increase default timeout for `createStakingOperation` to 10 min.
